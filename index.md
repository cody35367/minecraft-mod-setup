# Using the Twitch app

## Prerequisites
- The Twitch app is installed and the user logged into this app (I did not verify if login is required). Can be downloaded [here](https://desktop.twitchsvc.net/installer/windows/TwitchSetup.exe) if needed.
- A purchase of Minecraft and a valid Mojang/Minecraft login.

Note: An existing installation of Minecraft (Jave Edition) will not be used in this setup and is not required. The Twitch app will download, install, and manage the customm Minecraft installation going forward. Most global configurations and saves can be found in the default minecraft home directory location (a.k.a. `%appdata%\.minecraft` on Windows).

## Setup
1. Open the Twitch app, select Mods -> Minecraft
2. Select 'Install' and wait for the process to finish. You should see the below once it is complete.
3. Open and a Windows File Explorer window, navigate to `%userprofile%\Twitch\Minecraft\Install`, and run `minecraft.exe`. Below is an example path.
4. Wait for the Minecraft Updater to finish and present you with the below login screen. Login (if not alreaady) and then close the Laucher.
